# Conclusion [[conclusion]]

Congrats on finishing this chapter! **That was the biggest one**, and there was a lot of information. And congrats on finishing the tutorial. Youâ€™ve just trained your first Deep RL agents and shared it on the Hub ðŸ¥³.

Thatâ€™s **normal if you still feel confused with all these elements**. This was the same for me and for all people who studied RL.

**Take time to really grasp the material** before continuing. Itâ€™s important to master these elements and having a solid foundations before entering the fun part.

Naturally, during the course, weâ€™re going to use and explain these terms again, but itâ€™s better to understand them before diving into the next chapters.

In the next chapter, weâ€™re going to reinforce what we just learn by **training Huggy the Dog to fetch the stick**.

You will be able then to play with him ðŸ¤—.
