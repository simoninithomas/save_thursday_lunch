# Conclusion [[conclusion]]

Congrats on finishing this chapter!Â There was a lot of information. And congrats on finishing the tutorial. Youâ€™ve just trained your first Deep Q-Learning agent and shared it on the Hub ðŸ¥³.

Take time to really grasp the material before continuing.

Don't hesitate to train your agent in other environments (Pong, Seaquest, QBert, Ms Pac Man). TheÂ **best way to learn is to try things on your own!**

In the next unit, **we're going to learn about Optuna**. One of the most critical task in Deep Reinforcement Learning is to find a good set of training hyperparameters. And Optuna is a library that helps you to automate the search.

### Keep Learning, stay awesome ðŸ¤—
