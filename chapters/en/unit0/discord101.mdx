# Discord 101 [[discord-101]]

Hey there! My name is Huggy, the dog, and I'm looking forward to train with you during this RL Class! Although I don't know much about bringing sticks (yet), I know one or two things about Discord. So I wrote this guide to help you learn about it!

Discord is a free chat platform. If you've used Slack, it's quite similar. There is a Hugging Face Community Discord server with 8000 members you can join with a single click here. So many humans to play with!

Starting in Discord can be a bit intimidating, so let me take you through it.

Unlike Slack, you have access to most channels. That means that there might be a bit more noise that what you would like. And I hate loud noise woof! bell Since channels are gathered by topic, you can mute individual channels or entire categories. For example, the Audio Lounge category is about ML for Audio which I don't care about, so I right click the category and then click Mute. Ah much better!
I still see so many channels woof. You can also collapse a category so you don't see channels that are not of interest.

## So which channels are interesting to me? [[channels]]

They are in the reinforcement learning lounge.
- `rl-announcements`: where we give the last information about the course.
- `rl-discussions`: where you can exchange about RL and share information.
- `rl-study-group`: where you can create and join study groups.
The HF Community Server has a thriving community of humans interested in many areas, so you can also learn from those. There are paper discussions, events, and many other things. Here are other channels in the community

Was this useful? There are a couple of tips I can share with you:

There are voice channels you can use as well, although most people prefer text chat.
You can use markdown style. So if you're writing code, you can use that style. Sadly this does not work as well for links.
You can open threads as well!
I hope this is useful! And if you have questions, just ask! See you later!
