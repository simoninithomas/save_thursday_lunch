<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit0/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Deep RL Course thumbnail" width="100%"/>

Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence: Deep Reinforcement Learning.

This course will **teach you about Deep Reinforcement Learning from beginner to expert**. It’s completely free.

In this unit you’ll:

- Learn more about the **course content**.
- **Define the path** you’re going to take (either self-audit or certification process)
- Learn more about the **AI vs. AI challenges** you're going to participate to.
- Learn more **about us**.
- **Create your Hugging Face account** (it’s free).
- **Sign-up our discord server**, the place where you can exchange with our classmates and us.

Let’s get started!

## What to expect? [[expect]]

In this course, you will:

- 📖 Study Deep Reinforcement Learning in **theory and practice.**
- 🧑‍💻 Learn to **use famous Deep RL libraries** such as Stable Baselines3, RL Baselines3 Zoo, Sample Factory and CleanRL.
- 🤖 **Train agents in unique environments** such as SnowballFight, Huggy the Doggo 🐶, MineRL (Minecraft ⛏️), VizDoom (Doom) and classical ones such as Space Invaders and PyBullet.
- 💾 Publish your **trained agents in one line of code to the Hub**. But also download powerful agents from the community.
- 🏆 Participate in challenges where you will **evaluate your agents against other teams. But also play against AI you'll train.**

And more!

At the end of this course, **you’ll get a solid foundation from the basics to the SOTA (state-of-the-art) methods**.

You can find the syllabus on our website 👉 <a href="https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/">here</a>

## What the course look like? [[course-look-like]]
The course is composed of:

- *A theory part*: where you learn a **concept in theory (article)**.
- *A hands-on*: with a **weekly live hands-on session** in ADD DATE every week at ADD TIME. where you'll learn to use famous Deep RL libraries such as Stable Baselines3, RL Baselines3 Zoo, and RLlib to train your agents in unique environments such as SnowballFight, Huggy the Doggo dog, and classical ones such as Space Invaders and PyBullet.
We strongly advise you to participate to the live so that you can ask questions but if you can't participate in the live, the sessions are recorded and will be posted.
- *Challenges* such AI vs. AI and leaderboard.


## Two paths: choose your own adventure [[two-paths]]

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit0/two-paths.jpg" alt="Two paths" width="100%"/>

You can choose to follow this course either:

- *To get a certificate of completion*: you need to complete 80% of the assignments before the end of March 2023.
- *As a simple audit*: you can participate in all challenges and do assignments if you want, but you have no deadlines.

Whatever path you choose, we advise you **to follow the recommended pace to enjoy the course and challenges with the most classmates.**
You don't need to tell us which path you choose. At the end of March, when we verify the assignments **if you get more than 80% of the assignments done, you'll get a certificate.**



## How to get most of the course? [[advice]]

To get most of the course, we have some advice:

1. <a href="https://discord.gg/ydHrjt3WP5">Join or create study groups in Discord </a>: studying in groups is always easier. To do that, you need to join our discord server.
2. **Do the quizzes and assignments**: the best way to learn is to do and test yourself.
3. **Define a schedule to stay in sync: you can use our recommended pace schedule below or create yours.**

## What tools do I need? [[tools]]

You need only 3 things:

- A computer with an internet connection.
- Google Colab (free version): most of our hands-on will use Google Colab, the **free version is enough.**
- A Hugging Face Account: to push and load models. If you don’t have an account yet you can create one here (it’s free).

## When do the challenges start? [[challenges]]

In this new version of the course, you have two types of challenges:
- A leaderboard to compare your agent's performance to other classmates'.
- AI vs. AI challenges where you can train your agent and compete against other classmates' agents.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit0/challenges.jpg" alt="Challenges" width="100%"/>

These AI vs.AI challenges will be announced **later in December**.
